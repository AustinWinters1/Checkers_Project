## Overview
This is a checkers game built by Austin Winters and Dakota Carpenter as the project for our CS 470 class.
The game consists of clicking the first square to select a piece and the next click to move a piece as long as it is an empty square and is one square forward. The move will fail if the square isn't a white square, there is a piece occupying the space, the space is too far away, or if the space is an adjacent white square. The pieces are only allowed to move diagonally.
## Starting The Game
To start the Checkers game program you can either go to the Checkers folder and then double-click on the jar file or you can use java -jar Checkers_Java8.jar command in the command line, make sure you are in the Checkers directory when the command is executed.
